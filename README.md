Condensate is a small(ish) css library with intuitive h-box/v-box layouting, no-javascript components, and easy themeing through css variables.

> [!NOTE]
> Condensate is still in development and not yet ready for production use.

The `index.html` document showcases most of the components and is hosted [here](https://icosahunter.github.io/condensate/).
