Condensate is a small(ish) css library with intuitive h-box/v-box layouting, no-javascript components, and easy themeing through css variables.

The project is currently under development and not ready for use yet, but feel free to try it out, any feedback is welcome.

The `test.html` document showcases most of the components. In the future this will evolve into a more proper demo and documentation page.
